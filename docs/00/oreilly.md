### Accessing O'Reilly

O'Reilly is a technical publisher that provides a great number of useful books to Northeastern students.

To access O'Reilly, you will need to *follow the instructions closely*

Go to the following address

You should now have access, and if you want you can create a permanent account *once already logged in*.
